# Resume-Ready Project Description

Designed and implemented a cloud-native, serverless transaction processing
platform on Microsoft Azure using Azure Functions, API Management, Cosmos DB,
Service Bus, Event Grid, Databricks, and Microsoft Fabric.

The platform processes high-volume transactional requests with sub-second
latency, uses an event-driven architecture for audit logging and traceability,
and achieves 99.9% uptime through retry policies, dead-letter queues, and
comprehensive monitoring.

Key responsibilities included:
- Designing REST APIs using Azure Functions and API Management
- Implementing event-driven workflows using Event Grid and Service Bus
- Building audit pipelines using Databricks and Fabric Lakehouse (Delta)
- Configuring monitoring, alerts, and operational dashboards
- Ensuring fault tolerance, scalability, and observability
